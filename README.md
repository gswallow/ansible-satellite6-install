Ansible Satellite 6 Install
===========================

Role to install and do basic configuration of Red Hat Satellite 6.X.

INFORMATION
-----------

This playbook will take a while to run depending the number of repositories to
sync.

Requirements
------------

You will need ansible and all the required subscriptions for RHEL 7 and
Satellite 6. Also please use some role for set NTP on your server. We recommend
you use ansible-galaxy and install role for NTP **bennojoy.ntp** like we do.

Note that this example also uses **zaxos.lvm-ansible-role** just recently.

You will need a subscription manifest that **matches the version of Red Hat
Satellite Server** you plan to install before getting started.

Role Variables
--------------

All variables are in files located in ./vars and are imported with specifics
tasks.

But to be open for others we decided specify only related variables there and
all mandatory variables you have to specify in playbook vars or pass in extra
vars parameter.

You can check default vars located in ./defaults/main.yml, where we specify
these variables you have to specify in your var file and overwrite them,
otherwise this role won't work properly.


Dependencies
------------

There is no role dependency for this role.

Inventory File
----------

The hosts file in playbook_examples simply uses the HOSTGROUP environment varialbe, like so:

```
HOSTGROUP=satellite-server ansible-playbook -i /tmp/ansible/hosts -e '{satellite_deployment_vars: /tmp/ansible/seed}' config.yml --skip-tags firewall,capsule,set_network -c local
```

After this copy the download file inside the /files directory on the role and
